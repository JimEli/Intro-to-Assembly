CIS-250 Labs.

Lab #1: Hello World Program. Adaptation of Kip Irvine's Project_sample for CIS 250 Lab #1. Display a simple text message on the console and perform some very basic math on numbers input by user. Checks for signed 32-bit integer overflow.

Lab #1 EC: Using lab1.asm as your start. Ask the user for 2 different numbers. Subtract them. If the difference is zero, print "the numbers are equal". If the difference is positive, print "the first number is greater than the second". If the difference is negative, print "the second number is greater than the first one".

Lab #2: Multiplication Fun! Part 1: Create a procedure, and in that procedure multiply two numbers together using mul. Then call the procedure from the main procedure. Part 2: Do bitwise mulitiplication using only shift and add statements. In your multiplication procedure multiply two numbers not using mul but by combining a fixed number of shift and add commands. For this part you only need to be able to handle 8 bit numbers so you don't need to use a loop for this part. Part 3: Add loop to bitwise multiplication procedure. Instead of using a fixed number of bitwise multipliers, use a loop to run the bitwise multiplication. Create a bitwise division procedure.

* Binary division by shift/subtraction researched here: http://courses.cs.vt.edu/~cs1104/BuildingBlocks/divide.030.html

Homework #6: ASM program that draws a square using ASCII characters and ASM video commands. Utilizes the extended ASCII character set.

Homework #7: FPU code to calculate:  double P = -M * (N + B);

Homework #8: BubbleSort.
