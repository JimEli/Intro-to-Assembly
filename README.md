Lab #1: Hello World Program. Adaptation of Kip Irvine's Project_sample for CIS 250 Lab #1. Display a simple text message on the console and perform some very basic math on numbers input by user. Checks for signed 32-bit integer overflow.

Lab #1 EC: Using lab1.asm as your start. Ask the user for 2 different numbers. Subtract them. If the difference is zero, print "the numbers are equal". If the difference is positive, print "the first number is greater than the second". If the difference is negative, print "the second number is greater than the first one".

Homework #6: ASM program that draws a square using ASCII characters and ASM video commands. Utilizes the extended ASCII character set.

Homework #7: FPU code to calculate:  double P = -M * (N + B);
